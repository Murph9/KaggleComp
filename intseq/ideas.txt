	Order Reduction thingy (ask Jarrod)
	Fibonachi-like Squence (need to generalise)
	Binary Expansion (evil numbers)
	numbers written in base 2: https://oeis.org/A007088
	number of n <= 2^n x^2+10y^2	https://oeis.org/A000024
	beads
    initial digit of n https://oeis.org/A000030 (YAY)
	recursion function with one intial number https://oeis.org/A014827


	
order reduction more info:
	finds the highest power and its coeffiecient. highest power is len(array)-2. number of reduction steps to array of same numbers = highest order, O().
	Once the highest power is found (with coefficient), subtract from series and find next lowest power, repeat ill constant.
